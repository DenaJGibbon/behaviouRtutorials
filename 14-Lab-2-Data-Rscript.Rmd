# Exercise 1: Enter and visualize ethogram data
# This is a toy ethogram with some simulated data
EthogramDF <- data.frame(Behavior=c('Resting','Locomotion','Foraging','Calling','Playing','Other'),
                         TimesObserved=c(5,7,3,21,1,0))

# If you run the object 'Ethogram' you should see your table 
EthogramDF

# Now we can make a basic barplot to visualize our results
ggbarplot(data=EthogramDF, x='Behavior', y='TimesObserved',fill='grey')

# In the space below I want you to add in your own ethogram categories and create a plot based on the 
# ethogram you created in Field lab 1.
# Change Category1, Category2 to the categories you used in your ethogram and the numeric values to 
# your observed values
EthogramDFupdated <- data.frame(Behavior=c('Category1','Category2','Category3','Category4','Category5','Category6'),
                                TimesObserved=c(1,2,3,4,5,6))

# If you run the object you should see your dataframe

# Exercise 2.Calculate meerkat activity budgets. Our previous ethograpm examples only included counts of different behaviors that
# we observed, but we did not standardize our results in any way. Activity budgets give an indication of 
# how much time an animal spends doing each activity; these are generally expressed as percentages.

# First we need to import the data
data('MeerkatFocalData')

# Let's check the structure of our data 
str(MeerkatFocalData) 

# Then we calcuate the total number of sections for each behavior
# There are many different ways that we can summarize our data using R, but we will use the package
# 'dplyr'

# Here we take the sum for each unique behavior and return it 
MeerkatFocalData %>%  
  dplyr::group_by(BehaviorCode) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(TotalSeconds = sum(SecondsEngagedinBehavior))

# We need to save the output as an R object
MeerkatFocalDataSummary <- MeerkatFocalData %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(BehaviorCode) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(TotalSeconds = sum(SecondsEngagedinBehavior))


# Now we need to standardize for our total observation time
# We divide by 600 because our video was 10 minutes (or 600 seconds) long
MeerkatFocalDataSummary$ActivityBudget <- MeerkatFocalDataSummary$TotalSeconds/600*100

# Now let's plot our results.
# NOTE: The example here is using fake data.
ggbarplot(data=MeerkatFocalDataSummary,x='BehaviorCode',y='ActivityBudget',fill='grey')

# Now lets see if there were differences between you and your partner
# We need to save the output as an R object
MeerkatFocalDataPartner <- MeerkatFocalData %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(BehaviorCode,Partner) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(TotalSeconds = sum(SecondsEngagedinBehavior))

# We divide by 600 because our video was 10 minutes (or 600 seconds) long
# We then multiply by 100 so that we can report in percentages.
MeerkatFocalDataPartner$ActivityBudget <- MeerkatFocalDataPartner$TotalSeconds/600*100

# Now we compare our data with our partner's
# Note that there are two new lines in the code below
# The fill argument tells R which category or factor to use to color the bars.
# The position argument tells R to place the bars side-by-side.
ggbarplot(data=MeerkatFocalDataPartner,x='BehaviorCode',y='ActivityBudget', fill='Partner',
          position = position_dodge(0.9))

# Exercise 2c. Scan sampling and inter-observer reliability.
# Read in the data
data('MeerkatScanData')

# Check the structure of our data
# If we use 'head' it will return the first few rows of our dataframe
head(MeerkatScanData)

# For this analysis the 'Time' column isn't needed so we can remove it; It is the first column so we use 1 in the code below.
MeerkatScanData <-MeerkatScanData[,-c(1)]

# R deals with blanks in dataframes by converting them to 'NA'. This is useful for some cases,
# but we want to convert our blanks to zeros using the following code.
MeerkatScanData[is.na(MeerkatScanData)] <- 0

# Here we take the sum for each unique behavior and return it 
MeerkatScanData %>%

            OutOfSight=sum(OutOfSight),

# We need to save the output as an R object
MeerkatScanDataSummary <- MeerkatScanData %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Treatment,Partner) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(Vigilant = sum(Vigilant),
                   OutOfSight=sum(OutOfSight),

MeerkatScanDataSummaryLong <- melt(MeerkatScanDataSummary, id.vars=c("Treatment", "Partner"))

# Again we can plot our results
ggbarplot(data=MeerkatScanDataSummaryLong,x='Treatment',y='NumberMeerkats', fill='Behavior',
          position = position_dodge(1))

# And now we can visually compare our results with our partners
ggbarplot(data=MeerkatScanDataSummaryLong,x='Treatment',y='NumberMeerkats', fill='Behavior',
          position = position_dodge(0.9),facet.by = 'Partner')

# Now we want to calculate inter-observer reliablity
# NOTE: that you will want to change the A and B to the names you used in the datasheet
Partner1Data <- subset(MeerkatScanData,Partner=='A')
Partner1Data <- Partner1Data[,-c(5)] # We remove the 'Partner' column so that we only focus on scans

Partner2Data <- subset(MeerkatScanData,Partner=='B')
Partner2Data <- Partner2Data[,-c(5)] # We remove the 'Partner' column so that we only focus on scans

# Here we calculate reliability for vigilance
VigilantCorrelation <- cor(Partner1Data$Vigilant,Partner2Data$Vigilant)

# Here we calculate reliability for vigilance
NotVigilantCorrelation <- cor(Partner1Data$NotVigilant,Partner2Data$NotVigilant)

# Here we calculate reliability for out of sight
