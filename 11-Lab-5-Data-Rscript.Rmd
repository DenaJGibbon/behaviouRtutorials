# Appendix 5. Estimating Population Density and Biodiversity  {-}
```{r,  eval=F, echo=T}
# First we load the necessary libraries
library(behaviouR)

# Then we read in our data
data('CensusData')

# Part 1. Population density estimation. 
# First let's focus on your data
# NOTE you need to change 'A' to the name you used 
MyCensusData <- subset(CensusData, Partner=='A')

# Now we will subset the data to focus on your focal species for density estimation
# NOTE in this example we subsetting the data so that we only have the squirrels; you will need to change
# the code to subset based on your focal species
MyCensusDataFocal <- subset(MyCensusData, Species=='squirrel')

# Here we will determine the width of our sampling area by creating a histogram of
# perpendicular detection distances.

hist(MyCensusDataFocal$PerpendicularDistance,xlab='Perpendicular distance (D)',
  ylab='Number of observations',main='')

# In this example there is a clear break between 15 and 20 meters, so we will 
# only use observations that were within 15 meters. 
# NOTE: Your data will look different than this!

# Change the value to the cutoff point indicated in your data
CutOffPoint <- 15

MyCensusDataFocalAdjusted <- subset(MyCensusDataFocal,PerpendicularDistance <CutOffPoint )

# Now we need to subset by each site
# NOTE: You will need to change to the site names you used

MyCensusDataFocalSiteA <- subset(MyCensusDataFocalAdjusted,Site=='SiteA')

MyCensusDataFocalSiteB <- subset(MyCensusDataFocalAdjusted,Site=='SiteB')

# Now we will calculate the population density based on our two surveys
# Change the following to indicate the distance (in meters) of your survey for site A

SiteACensusDistance <- 500

# Now we will calculate the area of our census. The sample area (a) is equal to the length of the
# transect multiplied by twice the width or a= 2wl. We divide by 1000 to convert our answer to square kilometers.
SiteACensusArea <- 2*SiteACensusDistance*CutOffPoint/1000

# Now we need to calculate the number of animals using the following code
NumberFocalAnimalsSiteA <- nrow(MyCensusDataFocalSiteA)

PopulationDensitySiteA <-NumberFocalAnimalsSiteA/SiteACensusArea
PopulationDensitySiteA


SiteBCensusDistance <- 500

# Now we will calculate the area of our census. The sample area (a) is equal to the length of the
# transect multiplied by twice the width or a= 2wl
SiteBCensusArea <- 2*SiteBCensusDistance*CutOffPoint/1000

# Now we need to calculate the number of animals using the following code
NumberFocalAnimalsSiteB <- nrow(MyCensusDataFocalSiteB)

PopulationDensitySiteB <- NumberFocalAnimalsSiteB/SiteBCensusArea
PopulationDensitySiteB

# Now we can compare population density using the following code. Was the population density of site A higher than site B?
PopulationDensitySiteA > PopulationDensitySiteB

# Was the population density of site B higher than site A?
PopulationDensitySiteB > PopulationDensitySiteA

# **Question 1**. What were the population density estimates (reported as number of individuals per square kilometer) for your two sites? 
#Do your results of the population density estimates match your predictions? Why or why not?

# Part 2. Comparing biodiversity

# First, we will estimate the alpha diversity, or the diversity within a particular area or ecosystem.
# The alpha diversity is simply the number of different species present at each site
# Here we subset by partner and site A (you may need to change these!)
MyCensusDataSiteA <- subset(MyCensusData,Partner=='A' & Site=='SiteA')

# What were the unique species present?
unique(MyCensusDataSiteA$Species)

# How many unique species were there?
SiteANumberSpecies <- length(unique(MyCensusDataSiteA$Species))
SiteANumberSpecies

# Here we subset by partner and site B (you may need to change these!)
MyCensusDataSiteB <- subset(MyCensusData,Partner=='A' & Site=='SiteB')

# What were the unique species present?
unique(MyCensusDataSiteB$Species)

# How many unique species were there?
SiteBNumberSpecies <- length(unique(MyCensusDataSiteB$Species))
SiteBNumberSpecies

# What was the species richness for both sites sampled?
unique(c(MyCensusDataSiteA$Species,MyCensusDataSiteB$Species))

# **Question 2**. Which of your sites had higher species richness (i.e. number of species)?

# Now we will estimate beta diversity, which estimates changes in species diversity between
# ecosystems or along environmental gradients

# Beta diversity = 2c / S1 + S2

# This code tells us which species both sites have in common
intersect(unique(MyCensusDataSiteA$Species),unique(MyCensusDataSiteB$Species))

# Now we calculate the number of species in common
SpeciesInCommonBothSites <- length(intersect(unique(MyCensusDataSiteA$Species),unique(MyCensusDataSiteB$Species))
)
SpeciesInCommonBothSites

# Scientists are often interested in the community similarity between sites. For this
# we will calculate Sørenson’s index; a value of 1 means exactly the same number of species
# a value of 0 means no overlap
2*SpeciesInCommonBothSites/ (SiteANumberSpecies+SiteBNumberSpecies)

# Now we will use your partner's data
MyPartnersCensusDataSiteA <- subset(CensusData,Partner=='B' & Site=='SiteC')
unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteA$Species)
length(unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteA$Species))
SiteANumberSpecies <- length(unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteA$Species))
SiteANumberSpecies

MyPartnersCensusDataSiteB <- subset(CensusData,Partner=='B' & Site=='SiteD')
unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteB$Species)
length(unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteB$Species))
SiteBNumberSpecies <- length(unique(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteB$Species))
SiteBNumberSpecies

# What was the species richness for both sites sampled?
unique(c(MyPartnersCensusDataSiteA$Species,MyPartnersCensusDataSiteB$Species))


# **Question 3**. How did the alpha diversity of each of your sites compare with that of your partner?


# Gamma diversity is total species over a large area or region; there are many different ways
# that this can be measured. The way we will do it is a bit of an oversimplification by simply
# comparing the number of species seen during the census at both locations.

# First we subset by the first partner
MyCensusData <- subset(CensusData, Partner=='A')
unique(MyCensusData$Species)

# Then we plot the results
gghistogram(data=MyCensusData, x='Species',stat="count")

# Now we subset by the second partner
MyPartnersCensusData <- subset(CensusData, Partner=='B')
unique(MyPartnersCensusData$Species)

# Then we plot the results
gghistogram(data=MyPartnersCensusData, x='Species',stat="count")


# Now we can plot all the data together, separated by partner
gghistogram(data=CensusData, x='Species',stat="count",
            facet.by = 'Partner',fill='Partner',x.text.angle =90)+xlab('Species')+ylab('Number of individuals')

# **Question 4**. How did the gamma diversity of your site compare with that of your partners?

# There are special packages in R that can measure different diversity indices, as this is a tool
# many ecologists use. We will use the 'vegan' package.
library(vegan)

# First we need to convert our data into a table thate can be used to calculate the indices.
BiodiversityTable <- table(CensusData$Site,CensusData$Species)

#Simpson's Index (D) measures the probability that two individuals randomly 
# selected from a sample will belong to the same species (or some category other 
# than species). With this index, 1 represents infinite diversity and 0 means no diversity.
H <- diversity(BiodiversityTable,index="simpson")
H

# Species evenness refers to how close in numbers each species in an environment is. We can calculate
# that using the following code. The value is constrained between 0 and 1, with communities that
# that have a more even representation of species having values closer to 1.
J <- H/log(specnumber(BiodiversityTable))
J

# **Question 5**. Which of the four sites was most diverse? Which was the most even? Why is it
# important to consider diversity and evenness when studying biodiversity?
