# Appendix 6 R script. Analyzing camera trap data  {-}

# First we load the required libraries

library(ggpubr)

# We will be taking random subsets of the camera trap photos, and we
# use 'set.seed' to make sure that our results are reproducible.
set.seed(2210)

# We can use the following code to query the database by season to see
# which photos are available. The available seasons are 1-4, 6-8,10,11.
# This function will return a table with all of the available camera
# trap photos for a particular season.
CameraTrapAnnotations(season = 1)

# Now we will use another function to download the camera trap photos
# and save them locally to our computer.  You can change the season
CombinedAnimalDF <- CameraTrapDataAccess(urlpath = "https://lilablobssc.blob.core.windows.net/snapshotserengeti-unzipped/",

# Here we isolate only the columns from the dataframe that we need.
CombinedAnimalDF <- CombinedAnimalDF[, c("category_id", "season", "location", 
                                         "filename")]

# Here is the function to view photos and annotate data.

CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAdded

# Optional: You can save your spreasheet using the following code:
# write.csv(CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAdded,'CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAdded.csv)

# You can then load it back in later using the following code.
# CombinedDFTimes <- read.csv('CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAdded.csv')

# Now we load your data sheet with the times added NOTE: we are using
# sample data here; you will want to use your own data
data("CombinedDFTimes")

# CombinedDFTimes <- CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAdded

# Let's check the structure
head(CombinedDFTimes)

# Now we can make a density plot that will show the distribution of
# camera trap photos that were taken over 24-hours. We add the fill =
# 'category_id' so that we show different distributions for each
# animal.
ggdensity(data = CombinedDFTimes, x = "Time", fill = "category_id") + xlab("Time (24 hrs)") +

# Question 1. What do you notice about the overlap of the two density
# curves? Does it look like there is temporal niche partitioning?

# Now we can calculate an overlap coefficient which can be used to
# investigate potential competitive and interaction possibilities
# between species.The value ranges from ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1
# (complete overlap).

# First we subset our data to focus on the first animal in our dataset
FirstAnimal <- subset(CombinedDFTimes, category_id == "zebra")

# Then we subset our data to focus on the second animal in our dataset
SecondAnimal <- subset(CombinedDFTimes, category_id == "wildebeest")

# Now we use the overlap function to calculate the overlap coefficient
bayestestR::overlap(FirstAnimal$Time, SecondAnimal$Time)

# Question 2. How do you interpret the overlap coefficient for your
# data?

# Now we will read in our partners data. NOTE that you need to make
# sure the name of the .csv file is exactly as shown below.
#CombinedPartnerDFTimes <- read.csv("CombinedAnimalDF_TimeAddedPartner.csv")

# Let's check the structure

# Now we can make a density plot for our partner's data.
ggdensity(data = CombinedPartnerDFTimes, x = "Time", fill = "category_id") +

# Question 3. What do you notice about the overlap of the two density
# curves for your partner's data? Does it look like there is temporal
# niche partitioning?

# Now we can calculate an overlap coefficient which can be used to
# investigate potential competitive and interaction possibilities
# between species.The value ranges from ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1
# (complete overlap).

# First we subset our data to focus on the first animal in your
# partner's data set
FirstAnimalPartner <- subset(CombinedPartnerDFTimes, category_id == "cheetah")

# Then we subset our data to focus on the second animal in our dataset
SecondAnimalPartner <- subset(CombinedPartnerDFTimes, category_id == "leopard")

# Now we use the overlap function to calculate the overlap coefficient
bayestestR::overlap(FirstAnimalPartner$Time, SecondAnimalPartner$Time)

# Question 4. What is the overlap coefficient for your partner's data?
# How do you interpret this?

# Now we will combine your data with your partners
AllDataCombined <- rbind.data.frame(CombinedDFTimes, CombinedPartnerDFTimes)

# And we plot the diel activity patterns for all four species
ggdensity(data = AllDataCombined, x = "Time", fill = "category_id", facet.by = "category_id") + 
  xlab("Time (24 hrs)") + ylab("Density")

# Question 5. Based on the activity patterns and your understanding of
# the Serengeti food web how do you interpret these results? Is there
# evidence of temporal niche partitioning among potential competitors?
# What about interactions between potential predators and prey?
